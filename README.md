# ChainDB üöÄ

**A secure and efficient database solution for your private server, featuring encryption, automatic backups, and dual-node redundancy.**

## üåü Key Features:
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection to limit the number of requests within a defined time window, preventing abuse.
- **Backup System**: Regular automatic backups safeguard your data, with additional backups triggered after any server crash.
- **SHA256-Encrypted JSON**: All data is stored in JSON format and encrypted using the SHA256 algorithm for top-tier security.
- **Dual Node Support**: ChainDB is designed to run multiple server nodes that communicate with each other. If one node fails, the others take over to ensure maximum uptime.
- **Auto Backup on Crash**: Immediately triggers a backup when the server crashes, protecting your valuable data.
- **Web UI & üñ•Ô∏è App UI**: ChainDB includes a web-based interface and standalone app support for Linux and Windows.
- **API Support**: Exposes an API for third-party integration. **Important**: Always make sure third-party programs are secure to prevent data breaches!

## üîß How Dual Node Works:
A **node** in ChainDB refers to a server that handles your database and client requests. When multiple nodes are deployed:
- They communicate continuously to synchronize and share data.
- In the event of a failure, the remaining node(s) will take over operations.
- Each node monitors the others. If a node becomes unresponsive, the remaining nodes assume it has failed and shift workloads to avoid downtime until the failed node is back online.

### Can I Use More Nodes?
Yes, ChainDB supports more than just two nodes! You can deploy many nodes to increase redundancy and performance. However, **we do not recommend using more than 10 nodes** for a single database pool. Managing too many nodes for backup can become costly and inefficient.

Instead, if you have many nodes, consider creating separate **pools** of nodes.

### üí° What is a Pool?
A **pool** is a collection of nodes. For example, 2 nodes could form a pool, or even more nodes if needed. These pools can be used for different database instances or workloads. By separating nodes into pools, you can optimize costs and resources effectively.

### üîí Enhanced Security:
- When data is written to one node, it is securely replicated and encrypted using the SHA256 algorithm on both nodes.
- This ensures data consistency, security, and redundancy even if one server goes down.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notice:
When integrating ChainDB with third-party programs, ensure your data remains secure. ChainDB provides secure API access, but be sure to review and harden your third-party apps to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.


## Planned Future Updates:
-  Support for more encryption algorithms like AES.
-  Load balancing between nodes for enhanced performance under heavy loads.
-  Advanced monitoring and metrics through the web and app UI.
